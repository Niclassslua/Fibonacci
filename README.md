# Fibonacci

**The task was as follows:**

*In the Fibonacci sequence, each number calculates the sum of the two previous numbers. The first two numbers are defined as 0 and 1:*

**F0 = 0**

**F1 = 1**

**Fₙ = Fₙ-1 + Fₙ-2**


*Thus, the first five numbers are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3. Write a program "Fibonacci" that includes a number and then outputs the Fibonacci sequence in the corresponding length twice.* **Use a while loop.**
